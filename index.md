# Project Description
  Club Oven Lovin’ is a web-based platform that helps college students find, share, and cook affordable, easy-to-make meals using minimal kitchen resources.
  The system connects students, local vendors, and admins to create a community-driven recipe-sharing space. Students can browse and contribute recipes that include ingredient availability, cost, prep time, servings, and    dietary details. Vendors can provide information about ingredient pricing and stock, while admins oversee and manage all site content.
  This project aims to make healthy, realistic cooking accessible to students with limited resources while supporting local food options.
